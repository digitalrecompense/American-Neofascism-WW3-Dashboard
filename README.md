# American Neofascism WW3-Predictor Plot


###### I’ve created a timeline-based risk visualization on Linux using Matplotlib.

X-axis: Time (Jan 2025 → Jan 2026)

Y-axis: Risk score (0–1)

Red line / markers: Domestic Authoritarian Escalation (DAE)

Blue dashed line / markers: International Conflict / WW3 Risk (ICR_adj)

Event annotations: Key events like pardons, EOs, military deployments, and Alligator Alcatraz

Black dotted line: Critical WW3 tipping point at 0.9

###### Presently as the creator of the math and designer of the graph I believe this to tragically be a conservative representation of the risk. 

###### I hope and pray that I am wrong..
